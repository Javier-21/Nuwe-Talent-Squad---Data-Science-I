## Introduction
This repository contains my solution to a problem proposed by *Nuwe*.

## Problem
The problem in to predict the state of the rockets based on the values of their sensors.

To create the solution I have two files:
- **space_X_train.csv**: It contains 2100 records and seven columns, six are the values of the different sensors and the other is the state of the rocket.
- **space_X_train.csv**: It contains 900 records with only the values of the six sensors to predict the state.

The rocket can have five different states:
- **0**: Stable
- **1**: Light turbulence
- **2**: Moderate turbulence
- **3**: Severe turbulence
- **4**: Extreme turbulence
